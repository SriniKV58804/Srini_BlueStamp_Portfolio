# Portable Weather Station
I chose the portable weather station because at first I thought it was a really asthetic looking machine and when I saw it I thought I could maybe take it further like adding a alarm clock or being able to add the radio on it or since it will be connected to the internet I can add wallpapers and maybe even bluetooth. I saw so many possibilitys within this project and knew I had to choose it.

# Starter Project

# Description

For my starter project, I chose to build a calculator because I thought it would be a cool way to understand the basic mechanics of a device we use for simple math calculations every day. The process was quite challenging: I initially mixed up the steps, which took a while to correct, and my soldering iron was subpar, making it difficult to melt the solder wire properly. Additionally, assembling the plates was very frustrating due to the tiny and loose screws. Despite these obstacles, the experience was bittersweet. Completing the project and seeing the calculator work was incredibly satisfying, making all the effort and frustration worthwhile.


  
 # Final Milestone

For my third and final milestone, I installed the case for the board. My biggest challenge was that I wanted to use a 3D-printed case, but the screw holes weren't all the same size, so I had to use the default one from the kit. Additionally, the stickers were very difficult to remove because I have no nails. My biggest triumph at BSE was actually creating a working machine, despite struggling and making many mistakes along the way. In the future, I hope to learn more about building intricate machines and explore more projects.


# Second Milestone

<!-- For your second milestone, explain what you've worked on since your previous milestone. You can highlight:
- Technical details of what you've accomplished and how they contribute to the final goal
- What has been surprising about the project so far
- Previous challenges you faced that you overcame
- What needs to be completed before your final milestone -->

For my second milestone, I focused on running and testing the code. It failed a few times, but by carefully troubleshooting, I eventually got it to work. In my first milestone, I struggled with the code and where to place it, but after thoroughly following the instructions, I managed to get it running. For my final milestone, I need to install the case for the board.


# First Milestone

 <!--cFor your first milestone, describe what your project is and how you plan to build it. You can include:
- An explanation about the different components of your project and how they will all integrate together
- Technical progress you've made so far
- Challenges you're facing and solving in your future milestones
- What your plan is to complete your projectv -->

In my first milestone, I focused on placing the code in the correct locations and organizing the files. I used Python as my programming language. My main challenge was not placing the code correctly and having too many code.py files, which caused confusion about where the main code should go. I had to restart six times, with the last attempt nearly complete, but I persevered and asked for help when needed. After successfully organizing the code, the next step was running it on the board.


# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

# Bill of Materials
Here's where you'll list the parts in your project. To add more rows, just copy and paste the example rows below.
Don't forget to place the link of where to buy each component inside the quotation marks in the corresponding row after href =. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize this to your project needs.

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
